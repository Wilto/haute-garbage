This site isn’t using any third-party scripts, full stop. No Google Analytics, no Facebook “like” buttons, no Twitter embeds, no ads. There’s one tracker in play: a self-hosted, open source solution named [Matomo](https://matomo.org/), that only talks to a database I own.

Matomo tells me what pages someone visited on the site, how long they spent on each page, what link they clicked to get there (if any), and a guess at what part of the world they’re in. I don’t—and won’t—share that information with anyone.
