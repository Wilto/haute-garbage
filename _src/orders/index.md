That’s right. Starting in the fall of 2018, I’m gonna take some orders. I have a few things to get sorted out before orders open up for-realsies—but [stay tuned](https://twitter.com/wiltomakesfood) for further announcements, and don’t hesitate to [drop me a line](mailto:me@wiltomakesfood.com) if you’ve got something in mind right now. Orders likely won’t be open _all_ the time—I mean, I’m just one person, and I’m not retired from my day job just yet—but I got more time than I have excuses to bake, so _here we are_.

### Sichuan Chili Oil 

A little spicy and a little numbing, this all-purpose condiment is [a recipe](/recipes/chili-oil/) I’ve been tinkering with on and off for a long time. Don’t have the time or inclination to mix up a batch yourself? I got you.

| Quantity   | Price |
| ---------- | -----:|
| Half dozen |   $16 |
| Dozen      |   $32 |

### Macarons

Macarons are notoriously fussy, and you _know_ I love a fussy recipe. So much so, in fact, that I keep on making them—despite having bags and bags of macaron shells burnin’ a hole in my freezer as it is. Only you can save my household from this absurd cookie surplus.

| Quantity   | Price |
| ---------- | -----:|
| Half dozen |   $16 |
| Dozen      |   $32 |
<p class="table-note">Pricing for larger quantities available on request!</p>

### Cakes

Listen. I’m sick and tired of texting people to ask them whether they can think of any excuse for me to make them over-the-top cakes. Help me out by ordering a cake.

| Quantity                | Price |
| ----------------------- | -----:|
| Small (6", three layer) |   $60 |
| Small (9", three layer) |  $110 |
