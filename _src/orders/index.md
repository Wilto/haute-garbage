That’s right. Starting in 2019, I’m gonna take some orders.

[stay tuned](https://twitter.com/wiltomakesfood) for further announcements, and don’t hesitate to [drop me a line](mailto:me@wiltomakesfood.com) if you’ve got something in mind right now. 

Said orders likely won’t be open _all_ the time. I’m just one person, and I’m not retired from my day job just yet—but I got more time than I have excuses to bake, so _here we are_.

### Cakes

Listen. I’m sick and tired of texting people to ask them whether they can think of any excuse for me to make them over-the-top cakes. Help me out by ordering one, yeah?

| Quantity              | Price |
| --------------------- | -----:|
| 6", three layers      |   $60 |
| 9", three layers      |  $110 |
| 9", five layers       |  $180 |

<p class="table-note">Cakes are for local pick-up only. [Inquire](mailto:me@wiltomakesfood.com) for two or more tiers!</p>

#### White Mountain Cake

A snow-white vanilla layer cake, with a hint of almond.

#### Devil's Food Cake

Here’s the thing: Oreos cookies, but soft, and also cake. It’s plenty rich, thanks to a hint of espresso and three (3) kinds of chocolate—but not cloyingly sweet.

### Seasonal Macarons

Macarons are notoriously fussy, and you _know_ I love a fussy recipe. So much so, in fact, that I keep on making them—despite having bags and bags of macaron shells burnin’ a hole in my freezer as it is. Only you can save my household from this absurd surplus of fancy cookies.

| Quantity   | Price |
| ---------- | -----:|
| Half dozen |   $18 |
| Dozen      |   $32 |

#### Chocolate

Shells with a flavor not unlike your favorite chocolate cereal—but, y’know, _fancy_—sandwiched around a coffee-spiked dark chocolate ganache.

#### Mint Chocolate

I’m not a big holiday-flavors kind of dude, me—but I _am_ a sucker for peppermint, especially paired with chocolate.
