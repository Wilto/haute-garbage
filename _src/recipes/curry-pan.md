This might not come as much of a surprise to you, reader, but I end up with a lot of leftover curry. I’m not gonna fire up the rice maker over and over again just to work through a batch of curry experimentation over the course of a week—so, on day two, I whip up a batch of curry pan, chuck them in the fridge, and crisp them up in the toaster oven for a quick lunch.

To answer your next question: a lot. I spend a _lot_ of time at the gym. _A lot of time_.

Another reason it works well with leftovers is that, well, you want your curry filling a little… congealed, for want of a more appealing word. Too much liquid is gonna make it hard to seal the bread up, so they’re more likely to burst—and abruptly introducing water to hot oil isn’t generally good news. Pour off some of the liquid, and chop up or mash your… curry components—potatos, carrots, meat, etc.—so your filling is easier to wrap. Be sure to watch out for spitting oil either way—it’s a good idea to put a mesh cover over the oil while you’re frying these, or keep a lid handy.

Speaking of the gym: there’s a lot of punching, resting, and flattening in this recipe—you’re basically knocking the the yeast around before these hit the hot oil. We’re looking to _hold back_ the sort of oven spring you’d get baking any ol’ loaf of bread. A sudden spike in temperature will send yeast into high gear (until it gets _too_ hot inside the dough, and they burn out). It also produces steam, stretching the holes in the bread further. In a stand-alone loaf of bread, that’s often what you want—for these, we want the bread soft, but with a fairly tight crumb—more “bao” than “baguette,” y’know? In my experience, I’ll get two solid rises from off-the-shelf instant yeast, with a weaker third. So, these use a long first ferment—overnight in the fridge, ideally—for maximum bread-y flavor, a second rise that we completely ruin with the final shaping, and a weakened third and final “oven” spring in the hot oil.

No reason you _can’t_ bake these, though. I’m gonna ballpark 350°F, for about half an hour—until they’re golden brown. Skipping the breading and just hitting them with some egg wash probably wouldn’t go amiss, either. I’ll try it next time around, and update this post accordingly.

### I Think Japanese Curry is Weird and Gros—

_You’re weird and gross._

### …Okay? Wow?

Look—fine. Okay. It isn’t for everyone. I’m sorry for yelling.

Listen: you can fill these with _whatever_. There’s a reason every imaginable cuisine has some version of “bread, but with stuff in it”—it is because that is a thing that rules, and this is that, deep-fried. Fill them with leftover Indian take-out! Fill them with red bean paste for a heartier twist on _dou sha bao_. Pioneer bold and unconventional new Hot Pocket™ flavors. Fill them with other, smaller breads. Whisper a wish in there. I’m not gonna stop you.

But _do_ [let me know how it turns out](https://twitter.com/wiltomakesfood).
