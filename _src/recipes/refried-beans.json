		"in a 3qt. saucepan, heat lard/oil until shimmering, over medium heat. Add minced onion and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is translucent.",
		"Add herbs and cumin and cook until fragrant—only a minute or two. Stir in beans—drained, if from a can. Cook for a few minutes, stirring occasionally.",
		"Add stock (ideally the stock you simmered them in, if you’re using previously-dried beans) to cover, and simmer—uncovered—until the beans start to separate from their skins.",
		"Mash with the back of a spoon for a texture like the one pictured, or use an immersion blender to make a smoother purée. It’ll thicken more than you might expect; add stock in small amounts until you’ve reached your desired consistency.",
		"Stir in chili powder or hot sauce, salt and pepper to taste, and finely minced shallots, and serve."
