Okay, don’t— don’t, with that look. Some of you are _for sure_ out there side-eying this recipe, like I just said “oh ho ho well please understand that the secret weapon in the repitoire of any home chef worth their salt is” followed by some nasty old 1950’s-style aspic in the shape of—but not containing—a fish.

Béchamel is _good_, and—listen—I am using that accent mark because it is _correct_, not for purposes hoity nor toity. It’s butter, flour, and milk. It takes like five minutes. It’s easy, and don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. Fully half of the recipe is “make a roux”—which is two (2) whole ingredients, and the second half is “put hot milk in there.”

Throw a handful of cheese in this recipe, you’ve got a _sauce mornay_—which might _sound_ pretty fancy, but grating the cheese takes longer than the rest of the recipe combined. Use a white stock instead of milk, and you’ve got a _sauce velouté_. Boom; you’re two mother sauces deep now. 

Just don’t rush the roux part, even if you’re worried about it browning a little on you. Better to have it tip over into “ivory” territory—you can always start another one, or just chuck it in there anyway—than end up lending your final dish a chalky, raw flour taste. No take-backs on that.

### Of Roux and Ratios

If nothing else, look at this recipe as an excuse to get good at making a roux—you’re gonna need it for [curry rice](/recipes/curry/), you’re gonna need it for [croquettes](/recipes/croquettes/), and you’re gonna need it for chowders and stews.

The way it was taught to me at [Cambridge Culinary](http://cambridgeculinary.com/) There are three on-paper flour to butter ratios, depending on what it is you’re going to be thickening with a roux.

      <td class="numeric">1 Tbsp.</td>

All that said: if I need something thickened quickly, flavorlessly, and without any cloud—like a glossy pan sauce for a stir-fry—I’ll use cornstarch. It’s _just_ a thickening agent, and stays out of my way otherwise.

But a roux thickens while adding the richness of butter _and_ a wide range of toasty flavors—the latter of which you can control through the lightness of the roux. But keep in mind: the darker the roux, the less thickening power it has. That’s why my curry rice recipe uses a 1:1 ratio, even though it doesn’t end up all that thick.
