It was, by any measure, an awful place to live. I didn’t cook back then, not least of all because flames spewed out from underneath the oven when it kicked on. I mostly survived on nightly runs to the convenience store on the next block over—the one I could bring my dog into, not the one on the other next-block-over side.

With the exception of my apartment and the Applebees knockoff below it, I loved the hell out of that block. Not least of all because was—and is—home to Qingdao Garden. It was basically my cafeteria.
