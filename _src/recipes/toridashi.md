I’m calling this “toridashi,” but not confidently. I know “tori” means chicken and I know “dashi” means stock—but this is more of a pork stock than anything else. [The BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/toridashi_pork_and_55893) has a recipe for something kind of similar, and they call it “toridashi,” so hey, why not.

Leave out the shortribs and you’ve got my go-to chicken stock; leave them in and you’ve got something rich enough enough to hold up to [Curry Rice](/recipes/curry), form the basis for ramen, or just, y’know, _be_ a soup.

There are only a couple of things in here that you might have trouble finding at your local supermarket: _kombu_ and _katsuobushi_. They’re the basis for glutimate-rich _dashi_: a salty kelp and dried, smoked, fermented skipjack tuna flakes. Those might require a trip to a store that specializes in Japanese ingredients—or, y’know, Amazon.

### So, Yeah: Instant Pot

Let’s get this out of the way early on in the life of this blog: the Instant Pot is extremely good. I mean, it’s not _all_ good—the interface is largely inscrutable, and the “sauté” function tends to err a little on the side of “char”—but for my money, it beats the hell out of a stovetop pressure cooker. I’ll do a full review of it at some point.
