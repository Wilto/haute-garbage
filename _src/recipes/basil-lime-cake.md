2 sticks unsalted butter, slightly below room temp
1 8 oz. pkg cream cheese, slightly below room temp
2 C sugar
1/4 tsp salt
1/2 tsp vanilla
1 tsp baking powder
2 tsp baking soda

2 eggs, room temp, lightly beaten

520 g. cake flour
1/3 C. milk

4 Tbsp. lime juice
1 tsp fresh basil, finely minced
3 Tbsp. lime zest





In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine sugar, baking powder, salt, and butter. Mix on low speed to roughly incorporate, then increase to medium and beat until fluffy and light, about 5 minutes. About halfway through, pause to scrape the bowl and beater with a flexible spatula.

With the mixer still running, add the eggs one at a time, letting each fully incorporate before adding the next, then dribble in the vanilla. Reduce speed to low and sprinkle in about 1/3 of the flour, then drizzle in 1/3 of the milk. Repeat with remaining flour and milk, working in thirds as before.
