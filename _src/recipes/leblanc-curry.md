### Do as Sojiro Taught You

The ingredients and ratios are unchanged, right down to the kind of measures that, say, a gruff café owner with a heart of gold might use—like “小1個 ヨーグルト” which, near as I can tell, means “one small thing of yogurt.” Like a little single-serving container, y’know? Point is, definitely use the gram measures.

You can watch the video Atlus put out for the step-by-step process, though I’ve added a couple general-purpose curry tips in the instructions—like using a light-colored pan for the roux to get a better read on the color. Speaking of which:

### Follow Your Heart

I tend to skip the actual beef. If you wanna go that route, replace the water with beef stock—that is, if you have the [for real](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZmsy1k1_t0) stuff handy. If you’re working with box stock, chicken is gonna get you further. Full vegetarian? A nice rich vegetable stock will do the job.

Throw in some diced potatoes and [faux-tourné](https://rouxbe.com/tips-techniques/617-what-is-a-roll-cut-oblique-cut)’d carrots if you want, too—though I find this recipe to be a little carrot-heavy as it is.

Cut way back on the nutmeg if you’re freshly microplaning it, lest you end up with curry bordering on “festive.”

If you don’t have beef boullion cubes, put a little MSG in there; you _know_ that’s why that’s on the ingredient list. Sojiro is, after all, a man of _taste_.

Also, I wouldn’t fault you for using a food processor in place of all the grating, but remember that cellular-level damage [changes the potency of alliums](https://www.seriouseats.com/2015/01/how-to-mince-chop-garlic-microplane-vs-garlic-press.html). So, be sure to really “Crow’s Showtime” the hell out of them, if you get my meaning.
