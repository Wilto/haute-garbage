### Look, I am not up for a 13-step recipe.

Hard same. I’m one (1) more stressful event away from posting recipes to the tune of “dunk a Double Stuf Oreo in Lao Gan Ma. That’s dinner now. It’s the end of the world; who gives a shit.”

You got this one, though. It reads as steppy, but there are a bunch of breakpoints built into this thing.

You’ll be able to mix up the levain in ten minutes, tops. The filling and icing you can whip up quick and chuck in the fridge for whenever you’re done making the rest. The final dough comes together in fairly short order; it’s an easy dough to work with, and you can leave it in the fridge for a couple days before the final shaping. Fifteen minutes here, half an hour there. Make yourself some cinnamon rolls. They’re good.

### Natural Leavening vs. Instant Yeast

These are sourdough, on account of how it’s the kind of yeast that keeps on making more of itself, so I always have some. If you’re doing this with instant yeast, I’ll wager 2 tsp. of it will get you there—just disregard any of the timings in the recipe and keep a close eye out for those “roughly doubled in size” markers.
