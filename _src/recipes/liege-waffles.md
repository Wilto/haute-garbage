A very long time ago I worked at a CompUSA with a man named Mike “Gunface” McKenzie, guitarist and vocalist for the metal band [The Red Chord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Red_Chord). This is a recipe for waffles. Stay with me, here.

Mike did a lot of stomping and roaring. Like, generally. It wasn’t always in _response_ to anything, even; just the way he moved through the world. He was a friendly, positive, boundlessly enthusiastic dude. Also, he beat [Rygar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rygar).

More often than not, the arrival of Mike’s lunch would be heralded by a booming, guttural, _extremely_ metal “I LOVE _FOOD_” that could be heard throughout the entire lousy store. Not, like, with regards to a specific food. Mike was just pumped as hell that some food was around, and he could eat it. If the food was itself good, that was _extra_ good; like, man, what a time to be alive. The baseline experience was: 

1. THERE IS FOOD HERE.
2. IT IS FOR ME.
3. _HELL YEAH_.
 
This lesson has stuck with me.

These waffles contain four (4) kinds of sugar. They contain zero (0) implied moral value, positive or negative. Their redeeming quality is that they’re waffles; their value is that they taste good, and you can have them. The serving size is “as many as you want.” I’m not gonna “sneak” quinoa into ’em as though that makes them into, like, righteous waffles. Roar and stomp around your kitchen and enjoy the hell out of these.

### Buttermilk, huh?

Yep. While it _is_ typical of American waffles, it’s not typical of fancy, dessert-ier waffles.

Here, it serves two purposes: I tried it out in an effort to make the [browning a little more manageable](/articles/acid-browning/), but I’ve found that the tang of the buttermilk keeps these from tipping _too_ far into “dessert waffle” territory. I mean, if “sweeter” was the whole endgame, we could soak them in maple syrup, dust them with powdered sugar, or make cookies instead. The buttermilk gives them a little more complexity; it serves as a better backdrop for the occasional crunches of pearl sugar throughout. No syrup required, if you ask me, but I’m not gonna judge you for drizzling some on there.

Mike McKenzie did some sound work for Sesame Street, a few years back. This _absolutely_ makes sense to me.

When asked whether he drew inspiration from [watching Sesame Street as a kid](https://www.decibelmagazine.com/2016/07/13/red-chord-guitarist-gunface-on-recording-for-sesame-street/)

>  I still have the song “[Everybody Eats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kqOhF-RrFM)” in my head from time to time. 

_Hell yeah_.
