Let me begin this recipe with some crucial advice—not for this recipe, but for life. Beg, borrow, or steal a copy of <i>[Chinese Snacks](https://www.cookbookvillage.com/products/wei-chuan-cookbook-chinese-snacks)</i> by Huang Su-Huei, published by Wei-Chuan. It’s part of a set, the other half being <i>Chinese Cuisine</i>—which I only just managed to find and order from a used bookstore in Maryland.

This recipe isn’t from <i>Chinese Snacks</i>, which _does_ contain several recipes for this kind of dough (including a sourdough one). No, I cobbled this one together myself. It isn’t far off from the go-to dough recipe in the book, though, mostly by nature of the simplicity of the dough itself: a pretty standard yeast-raised, oil-enriched affair, with the “oven spring,” so to speak, bolstered by a little baking soda.

The only thing that might feel a little out-of-place on this one is the cake flour, which gives these a finer texture than strictly all-purpose would. That also means a little less gluten formation, which—even though this is a dry, sturdy dough—might’ve made it a little trickier to work with. So, I use a little AP flour for, y’know, structural integrity.

### Shaping

For <i>[gua bao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gua_bao)</i>, roll your pieces of dough into discs and fold them over a sheet of parchment to steam them, then fill them separately. For <i>[liu sha bao](http://www.bakeforhappykids.com/2014/02/liu-sha-bao-chinese-molten-salted-egg.html)</i>—my go-to for testing this recipe due to a macaron-induced surplus of frozen egg yolks—you just purse ’em up and flip them upside-down. For most baozi applications—well, [the technique itself isn’t too tricky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-yF13DqcqQ), but I don’t mind saying that I’m [still getting the hang of it myself](https://www.instagram.com/p/BlQlwa4FEvo).
