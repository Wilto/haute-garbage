_コロッケ_, _croquettes_, _croquetas_; call ’em whatever. They’re good as hell. I assume that’s why basically every type of cuisine has made a claim to “starchy mush, breaded and deep-fried.” I’m filing them under “yoshoku”—the western-influenced Japanese cuisine—because that was my early introduction to ’em.

What none of these cultures can seem to agree on, though, is whether they ought to be based on mashed potatoes (which is good) or a velvety béchamel (which is good). I’ve seen people draw a bafflingly hard line, here; they’ll claim that the _true_ croquette—the _ur_-croquette, if you will—_must_ be based on either potato or béchamel. All others are inferior imitations. 

Those who would claim a croquette binary—look, I’ll just say it: they’re _cowards_. They fear what they cannot understand; a depth of flavor that humanity was perhaps never meant to wield. 

But, reader: I stand before you with no such fear in my heart. I have stolen the deep-fried fire of the gods. Take my hand, and I will show you a new way—a new _world_ of flavor—if you have the _courage_.

### Use Both

It’s super good.
