lede: Most shortbread sucks pretty bad. This is a recipe for a shortbread that _isn’t_ like eating vaguely butter-scented IKEA furniture.

Look, I dunno if it’s showing, but I’m generally not a big fan of shortbread cookies, same as I’m not generally a big fan of eating a lightly buttered stack of cardboard bar coasters. I like vaguely buttery things well enough, but if we’re talking druthers, I’m gonna opt for your basic Star-Market-ass sugar cookie every time.

These are as much sugar cookie as they are shortbread. All the best crumbly, buttery characteristics of _good_ shortbread, but the marzipan gives them a extra sweetness, a ton of almond flavor, _and_ keeps them from turning into [Sheetrock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drywall). 

Slice them into squares, press them into circles, or cut them into rad shapes, then dip them in chocolate or get fancy with a batch of [your favorite royal icing](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2016/12/perfect-royal-icing-recipe.html). Or—and this is _crucial_—use this as the crust of a chocolate pie.
