lede: "You know those ads for marshmallow-centric breakfast cereals where they say they’re “part of a complete breakfast,” then show a tiny bowl of cereal, two grapefruits, six bran muffins, a ceasar salad, and a fistful of multivitamins sandwiched between two blocks of tofu?"

Well—eat ’em in the morning, and these too can be part of the same kind of complete breakfast. They’ve got oats in them, after all.

The only unusual thing going on in here is the five-spice powder—it compliments berry flavors in a big way. Used like this, it stands out _just_ enough to garner a couple of “what’s in these”-es, but not so much that anyone could pick it out of the ingredient line-up.

### The G-Word

I made a gluten-free batch of these suckers for someone, a couple weeks back. Replace the all-purpose with that “measure for measure” gluten-free flour (I used [Bob’s Red Mill](https://www.bobsredmill.com/shop/gluten-free/gluten-free-1-to-1-baking-flour.html)), and make sure to get the minute oats that say “gluten free” on ’em (I used [Quaker](https://www.quakeroats.com/products/hot-cereals/Gluten-Free-Quick-one-minute-oats)). Long as you’re reading your ingredient labels carefully—a subject with which you are well acquainted, I’m sure—you should be good to go.
