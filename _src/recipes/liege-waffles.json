	"instructions": [
		"In a large mixing bowl, or bowl of a stand mixer, stir together the flours, sugars, salt, and yeast. Add buttermilk, honey, and eggs, mixing until as close to fully incorporated.",
		"With the mixer running on low speed (or hand-mixing continually), add butter a tablespoon at a time; this step isn’t particularly fussy. Once no dry ingredients remain and the dough has come together into a shaggy ball, add pearl sugar and thoroughly fold it into the dough by hand.",
		"Form dough into a rough ball and set it in a clean, lightly greased bowl. Cover and allow it to rise for about an hour.",
		"After the hour has elapsed, preheat your waffle maker to low-medium heat. Remove dough to a lightly greased surface and roll it out to a thickness of half an inch or so, then cut it into rough chunks with a bench scraper. The size and shape of these are gonna depend on your waffle maker—just make sure you leave enough room for them to expand. Allow the dough to rest for twenty minutes before pressing it into a well-greased waffle iron."
