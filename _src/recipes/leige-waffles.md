A very long time ago, I worked at a CompUSA with a man named Mike “Gunface” McKenzie, guitarist and vocalist for [The Red Chord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Red_Chord).

This is a recipe for waffles. Stay with me, here.

Mike did a lot of stomping and roaring. It should be noted that this was very rarely in _response_ to anything; it was just the way he moved through the world. He was a friendly, positive guy.

More often than not, the arrival of Mike’s lunch would be heralded by a booming, guttural, _extremely_ metal “I LOVE _FOOD_” that was audible throughout the entire lousy store. Not, like, with regards to a specific food. Mike was just pumped as hell that some food was around, and he could eat it. If the food was itself good, that was _extra_ good; like, man, what a time to be alive. The baseline experience was: 1. food was present 2. you can eat it 3. _hell yeah_. This lesson has stuck with me.

Here’s the thing: I almost named this thing “_Haute Garbage_” instead of the much less catchy “_Wilto Makes Food_.” But that “garbage” part implies some kind of negative value, and that isn’t how we do. Food is great. _Mille-feuille_ is great. Spaghetti-Os are great. Maybe you’re into kale, and like, alright, _yeah_, enjoy the hell outta that kale. A fistful of Doritos straight off the kitchen counter? Hell yeah to that also.

If you’re gonna try assign a moral value to food, you can literally only do worse than “[we should make sure everyone has enough](https://www.smallcanbebig.org/).”

These waffles contain four (4) kinds of sugar. They contain zero (0) implied moral value, positive or negative. Their redeeming quality is that they’re waffles; their value is that they taste good, and you can have them. The serving size is “as many as you want.” I’m not gonna “sneak” quinoa into ’em as though that makes them into, like, righteous waffles. Roar and stomp around your kitchen and enjoy the hell out of these.

### Buttermilk, huh?

Yeah. While it _is_ typical of American waffles, it’s not typical of liège waffles. Here, it serves two purposes: I tried it out in an effort to make the [browning a little more predictable](/articles/acid-browning/), but I’ve found that the tang of the buttermilk keeps these from tipping too far into “dessert waffle” territory. Honestly, if “sweeter” was the whole endgame, we could soak them in maple syrup, dust them with powdered sugar, or make cookies instead. The buttermilk gives them a little more complexity, and serves as a much better backdrop for the occasional crunches of pearl sugar throughout. No syrup required, but
