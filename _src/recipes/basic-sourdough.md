lede: This recipe makes a nice little loaf in and of itself, for sure, but with a little remastering it can just as handily become a focaccia, sourdough baguettes, trap remix, whatever. The difference mostly comes down to the ratio of flours, amount of water, and number of airhorns you use.

Before you dive in, you might want to spend a little time with my accompanying [everything-there-is-about-bread article](/articles/understanding-sourdough). The secret, here, is that this isn’t much of a recipe—_no_ lean bread recipe is much of a recipe. Ultimately, we’re talking about four ingredients, one of which—salt—is _technically_ optional.

Put some flour(s) in a bowl, make ’em damp, introduce some single-celled wildlife: baby, you got a bread goin’.

### What’re all these flours?

The first is just bread flour—like all-purpose, but with more gluten-y potential. You can probably get it at the grocery store, but if not, hit up [King Arthur](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/shop/items/king-arthur-unbleached-bread-flour-5-lb) or [Bob’s Red Mill](https://www.bobsredmill.com/shop/flours-and-meals/artisan-bread-flour.html). Used ’em both, like ’em both.

The second one is whole wheat flour, which adds a little nutty, graham-cracker-y sweetness. Same deal: grocery store stuff, but again, I’ll vouch for both [King Arthur](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/shop/items/king-arthur-premium-100-whole-wheat-flour-5-lb) and [Bob’s Red Mill](https://www.bobsredmill.com/shop/flours-and-meals/whole-wheat-flour.html).

I like to add a little bit of [white rye flour](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/shop/items/white-rye-flour-3-lb), for a little extra bread-y funk. This one is in “special order” territory, but you can definitely go without; just tweak the ratios of the other flours to match—replace the white rye flour with either white or whole wheat, or add a little more of each.

### Baker’s Percentages

Anyway, here’s the recipe:

| Ingredients           | Baker’s Percentage |
| --------------------- | -----------------: | 
| White flour           |                85% |
| Whole wheat flour     |                10% |
| White rye flour       |                 5% |
| Water                 |                60% | 
| Salt                  |                 2% |
| Levain                |              12.5% |

### —What?

Hey, [I warned you](/articles/understanding-sourdough). Far be it from me to discourage a little winging it, though; give it hell either way, and [let me know how it turns out](https://twitter.com/wiltomakesfood).
