	"instructions": [
		"In a large, heavy-bottomed pot (I use an enameled cast icon dutch oven), over medium heat, heat about a tablespoon of neutral oil until just shimmering. Add ginger and garlic, and cook over medium-low heat until fragrant; only a few minutes. Add Marmite, mix, and cook for another minute or so.",
		"Add shallots, onions, a pinch of white sugar, and a few more tablespoons of oil. Stir and cook, covered, for about fifteen minutes.",
		"Carefully remove the lid (watch out for steam). The onions and shallots should have released most of their liquid; increase heat to medium-high, and reduce. As liquid evaporates, the aromatics should start to brown slowly; stir frequently, scraping fond from the bottom of the pot—add a spash of water or stock to help with this process, but don’t oversaturate. Continue stirring, scraping, and adding liquid in small increments; this part takes a long time.",
		"Once shallots, onions, garlic, and ginger are a uniform golden brown, add stock, tonkotsu sauce, cocoa powder, honey, and a bay leaf. Reduce heat to low-medium and simmer, uncovered, for about an hour.",
		"Remove bay leaf and blend until smooth using an immersion blender, if desired.",
		"Using a medium-sized saucepan, melt butter over medium heat until foaming. Stir in flour and cook, stirring, until roux reaches a rich chestnut brown. This should take at least 15–20 minutes; don’t rush it. Remove from heat, add curry powder and whisk to combine.",
		"Over low heat, add a ladel full of the stock mixture into the roux and whisk vigorously to combine—it should form a thick paste right away. Whisk this into the stock.",
		"Add carrots and potatoes and cook until fork tender; the curry will thicken in the meantime. Add frozen peas, cook just until fully thawed—a few minutes—and serve."
