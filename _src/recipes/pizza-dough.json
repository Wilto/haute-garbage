		"In a large mixing bowl (or the bowl of a stand mixer) combine all the ingredients except the water.",
		"Add <em>up to</em> 3/4 C. water in a slow trickle until the dough comes together in a shaggy ball.",
		"Hand-knead for ten minutes or so. If using a stand mixer, switch to the dough hook and knead at low-medium speed for seven minutes. Either way, keep going until the dough passes the <a href='https://slice.seriouseats.com/2010/09/technique-the-windowpane-test-for-pizza-dough.html'>windowpane test</a>.",
		"Shape into a ball and place in a clean, lightly oiled bowl. Cover, and let sit at room temperature for half an hour.",
		"Place in refrigerator overnight, making sure the dough has room to expand. If you’re storing it longer term, move it to the freezer the following day.",
		"When ready to bake, shape into a ball on a floured surface, dust with flour, cover loosely, and allow it to come to room temperature before shaping."
