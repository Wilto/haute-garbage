Well, okay, yeah, there are still a lotta onions in this. More than a pound, in fact, for what turns out to be a pretty modest helping of soup. There's nothing fancy going on in this department either: we had a red-plastic-mesh bag of run-of-the-mill, supermarket yellow onions and a shortage of dinner plans, so here we are.

### Caramelizing Onions (and Shallots)

This takes a long-ass time, despite what [other food blogs might have you believe](https://slate.com/human-interest/2012/05/how-to-cook-onions-why-recipe-writers-lie-and-lie-about-how-long-they-take-to-caramelize.html). A pinch of sugar speeds things along a _little_, as does a tiny pinch of baking soda. That said, countless batches of [curry rice](/recipes/curry-rice) have made me pretty good at getting it done in _relatively_ short order. Not "ten minutes, total" by any stretch, but maybe a spry half hour of stirring.

Twenty minutes at low-medium heat with a lid is gonna give you, well, not the prettiest arrangement of alliums you've ever seen in your life--something a little closer to a a stringy onion pudding. If you followed my advice on the baking soda, too, you might notice a little bit of a copper-green tinge to it. That isn't gonna hurt anything, but Instagram-worthy, it ain't. Take off the lid carefully; there's gonna be a lot of water on there.

Once you've reached this stage, lose the lid and dial the heat up to medium. You're on the clock now, stirring more or less non-stop for the next twenty minutes to a half hour.

Browning, here, is both the goal and the enemy. You want the whole slurry to _inch_ toward "uniformly golden," and you want to err on the side of _lighter_, not darker. Light golden onions are gonna be plenty cooked, but not as rich and sweet as they could me; dark brown onions are gonna introduce a lot of very unpleasant bitterness. I do this in an enameled cast iron, which I like for being a nice bright white on the inside: as soon as my slowly-browning onion sludge starts to scorch to the bottom of the pot even a little bit, I'll add a splash of my stock to deglaze it, which also keeps it from happening again--at least, until I need to repeat the process. Keep it moving and you'll be rewarded with surprisingly sweet _real_ caramelized onions.
