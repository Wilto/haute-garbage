	"instructions": [
		"Soak the noodles in hot water until they’ve <em>almost</em> reached the desired softness. This usually takes fifteen to twenty minutes for me. Whisk together fish sauce, light soy sauce, tamarind concentrate, palm sugar, and chili flakes.",
		"Over high heat, add tablespoon of peanut oil to your wok and heat until just smoking. Working in small batches, quickly stir-fry tofu until just golden, remove to a paper towel, and set aside. Do the same with any other optional ingredients.",
		"Working quickly, repeat this process with aromatics—stir-fry the shallot until just starting to brown, then add garlic and cook until golden. Add salted radish, cooking for just a few seconds. Add eggs, scrambling and breaking them apart with chopsticks or a plastic fork. Add noodles, tofu, and any additional ingredents, then re-whisk and add sauce mixture, tossing and stirring to coat. Cook just until noodles have reached desired softness; it should only take a minute or two. Add a splash of water if necessary.",
		"Fold in scallion greens, peanuts, and bean sprouts off heat.",
		"Serve with lime wedges and additional chili flakes."
