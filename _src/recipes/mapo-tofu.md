Don’t let that stop you, though: this recipe results in one of my favorite foods in this whole dumb world, and that’s a statement I don’t make lightly. The level of spice is, beyond a point, totally up to you. Plus, the whole thing takes like twenty minutes to put together once you’ve committed it to memory—you can whip some up for a quick lunch if you half it, but don’t. Make enough for leftovers. It’s better after a night in the fridge.

Now, I’m not what you’d call “spice averse.” I went to [Hell Night](https://www.seriouseats.com/2012/01/hell-night-at-east-coast-grill-russian-roulette-meatballs-cambridge-boston-ma.html) a couple times; I ordered—and finished—the [Pasta From Hell](https://uproxx.com/life/hell-night-east-coast-grill/2/). I’ve got whatever kind of brain chemistry problem it is that makes some of us seek out capsaicin—a chili pepper’s evolved defense _against_ being eaten—and the iron stomach to match. Well, maybe copper; I didn’t, uh, quite make it to work the next day.

That aside, I don’t have a lot of use for science-project spicy. Y’know, the little glass bottles of syrupy, purpleish, xenomorph-blood-flavored hot sauces someone gifts you as, like, a fun joke—they have a firetruck or the devil or some offensive nonsense on the label; you know the stuff.

This isn’t that; bright red though it may be, it isn’t some spicy-for-spicy’s-sake novelty thing. This recipe results in one of my favorite foods in this whole dumb world, a statement I don’t make lightly. Plus, the whole thing takes like twenty minutes to put together, start to finish, once you’ve committed it to memory—it’s something you can throw together for a quick lunch if you half it, but don’t. Make enough for leftovers. It’s better the second day. 

### Málà (麻辣)

I like hot sauce the way I like black pepper: for the synergistic effect it has on other flavors. For that reason, I dig on Sichuan food in a big way. It _is_ spicy, no question—but not taste-obliteratively so. For that, we have the Sichuan peppercorn to thank.

> The term málà is a combination of two Chinese characters: “numbing” (麻) and “spicy (hot)” (辣), referring to the feeling in the mouth after eating the sauce.

I know what you’re thinking—that just sounds like “hot.” Like, the numb lips that come with too-spicy food. Sichuan peppercorns aren’t peppercorns, though—they’re not related to peppers of any kind. They’re the empty husks of seeds from the prickly ash shrub—the seeds themselves are discarded.

Those husks contain _hydroxy-alpha-sanshool_, which—in the strictest culinary terms—tastes a little bit like licking a nine-volt battery feels, and we [straight-up don’t know why exactly](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/papers/17767493). That might not sound super appealing, surface level, but it works by activating the neurons responsible picking up innocuous sensations—chemically, it sends your brain a “everything is fine here” signal, like a gentle touch might produce. It does so to the point where your nervous system gets a little confused by a sharply rising chorus of escalating “_SOMETHING IS HAPPENING; IT’S FINE_” messages, and kinda shuts down a little. The result is a kinda-numb, kinda-tingly sensation that’s difficult to put to words.

This is the polar opposite of how hot peppers work. Capsaicin activates sensory neurons called “nociceptors,” which are normally responsible for detecting _thermal_ pain—hence the unique sensation of tasting the way hot feels. That reaction means sending your brain “_SOMETHING IS HAPPENING; IT’S BAD_” messages. It kicks off your whole fight-or-flight system, which is why some folks experience a “rush” from spicy food. You’re placing your whole endocrine system into a state of imagined crisis.

Scientifically speaking, _málà_ is _super confusing_. You’re simultaneously triggering two opposite biochemical reactions, and your brain is getting “EVERYTHING IS ON FIRE” and “NOTHING IS WRONG” signals at the same time. In print, it looks like a nightmare. In practice, it means getting all the fiery, flavor-enhancing benefits of _là_, with the unpleasant burn muted in a major way—it’s just as spicy, but less _hot_ somehow.

You gotta try it. You can finesse the spiciness by reducing or omitting the chili flakes; I’ve done it, and it’s still plenty flavorful.

### I’ve never heard of some of these ingredients

Well, it is _time to hear of them_. There are a bunch of things in here that are super common to Sichuan cuisine, but not so common to the average western pantry. Fortunately, we’re talking about dried stuff and fermented stuff—it all keeps for ages. You’ll find more uses for it all, especially if you like to chuck the occasional stir-fry together—I’m working on a guide to my favorite stir-fry pantry staples as we speak, so we’ll figure out some uses for ’em, I promise.

### Substitutions and Additions

I’ve swapped out the leeks for the whites and light green parts of a handful of scallions—it works great. I’ve swapped ’em out for two or three large shallots—also works great.

I’ve added Beyond Burger “ground beef,” seitans both bacon-ish and uh plain, and ground beef or pork (maybe five or six ounces). You probably get the idea, here; it all works great. If you wanna protein this up some, crisp up whatever you’ve got on hand at the very start—once you’ve brought the peanut oil back up to smoking, but before adding the chili paste.

### Required Reading

If you’re thinking about getting into Sichuan cooking, pick up a copy of <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Land-Plenty-Treasury-Authentic-Sichuan/dp/0393051773/">Fuschia Dunlop’s <i>Land of Plenty</i></a>. Everything I’ve tried from it so far has been <em>great</em>.
