Good news, though: there’s a best _budget_ chef’s knife, so you can go ahead and buy that one. After all, when you’re selling, you don’t want the presented options to be “buy this or don’t buy anything”—you want it present it as “buy this, or buy this other thing instead!” Gross.

[If you’ve been reading for a while](/articles/sharpening/), you can probably guess where I’m gonna land on this:

Whatever knife you like is the best chef’s knife, full stop.

So, I’m not gonna try to sell you any “fancy” 1,200%-off-in-a-Facebook-ad sushi knives, here. What I am gonna do is talk about some of the things I look for in a knife, in case it resonates with any of you out there that happen to be shopping around.

### The Handle

“Strictly decorative” at best, “sort of in my way” at worst. 

The usual decision here is between a _wa_-style handle (“Eastern”) and _yo_-style handle (“Western”). Western-style handles—your Wüsthofs and such—tend to have more squared handles, while Eastern style handles are either oval or octagonal. I like a _wa_-style handle, strictly because my Shun Classic was the first “fancy” knife I owned, and the one I logged the most hours with. Even then, though, I don’t really use the handle for anything.

Like most western cooks, I use a “pinch grip”—holding the back of the blade, mostly with my thumb and forefinger. That’s why things like [FINI Cutlery’s stubby-handled knife](https://www.finicutlery.com/) exist; the handle is just kind of dangling there with a pinch grip, so other than balancing the knife out, you don’t really need one. 

### The Cutting Edge

Now, I like high-carbon steel. Owing to a lifetime of woodworking, I don’t mind fussing over my tools a little—keeping them sharp, clean, dry, and so on.
